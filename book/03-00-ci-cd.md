# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

In this section, two continuous integration and deployment services will be
explored. [Travis CI][0] which is great for open source projects and [GitLab
CI/CD][1] which provides services for private projects.

Travis CI is free to use for open source projects, for example the [Trade
Wars][2] gamemode is open source on GitHub and uses the free Travis CI service
for testing and deployment.
