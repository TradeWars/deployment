# Repository

This section encapsulates the changes you'll need to make to your repository.
These changes are minor and shouldn't affect your overall workflow much.

Most tools nowadays involve some sort of "meta file" that exists in a code
repository (usually the root, but not always). Git does this with `.gitignore`
and `.gitattributes`. These next few pages will involve adding some of these
files to your repo to configure the tools.
